Welcome to the Smart Teaching Assistant codebase! This project aims to provide a natural language interface for answering questions based on Wikipedia data, utilizing advanced technologies such as the BERT model, Wikipedia-API, and SQuAD.

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This command initiates the Smart Teaching Assistant, allowing users to interact with the system and pose questions.

## Important Note

Make sure to configure any necessary environment variables or settings as specified in the documentation before running the code.
